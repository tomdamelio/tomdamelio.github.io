  Objective: To assess whether the eye-tracking approach of the RECOGNeyes game
  has potential therapeutic benefits for children with neurodevelopmental
  disorders, in particular attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
  RECOGNeyes is a computer game that is played using the eyes as the game
  controller. The rationale behind the game is that individuals with ADHD have
  an underdeveloped attention control system. This attention control system is
  underdeveloped not because they lack this capacity but because this ability
  has not been sufficiently developed. The game was designed as an intervention
  for training visual attention in ADHD.


  Methods: The sample included 28 children aged 8-15 years (18 aged < 12 y and 10 aged ≥ 12 y) previously diagnosed with ADHD (DSM-5 criteria). The participants were randomly divided into 2 groups. The experimental group played RECOGNeyes with eye-tracker for 3 weeks (3 times/week) at home, while the control group played the game using the mouse. Different attentional parameters were assessed before and after training. The study was conducted from January 2018-June 2018.


  Results: Participants from the eye-tracker group showed an improvement posttest compared to pretest in impulsivity (P = .0067), reaction time (P < .0001), and fixation gaze control (P < .0001). No changes were found in mouse control between pretest and posttest assessments.


  Conclusion: RECOGNeyes is a child-friendly, interactive game combined with eye-tracking technology that seems to provide an improvement in the visual attention system, which is especially indicated for ADHD patients. This game might be used as an alternative to pharmacologic therapy and may provide new insights into the treatment of ADHD.
