abstract: "It has been suggested that unconscious semantic processing is
  stimulus-dependent, and that pictures might have privileged access to semantic
  content. Those findings led to the hypothesis that unconscious semantic
  priming effect for pictorial stimuli would be stronger as compared to verbal
  stimuli. This effect was tested on pictures and words by manipulating the
  semantic similarity between the prime and target stimuli. Participants
  performed a masked priming categorization task for either words or pictures
  with three semantic similarity conditions: strongly similar, weakly similar,
  and non-similar. Significant differences in reaction times were only found
  between strongly similar and non-similar and between weakly similar and
  non-similar, for both pictures and words, with faster overall responses for
  pictures as compared to words. Nevertheless, pictures showed no superior
  priming effect over words. This could suggest the hypothesis that even though
  semantic processing is faster for pictures, this does not imply a stronger
  unconscious priming effect."
