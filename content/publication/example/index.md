abstract: The present study aimed to validate a Spanish-word database that
  elicits different levels of emotional response. To control subjects"
  engagement to the stimuli, an emotional Stroop task was administered to
  Spanish-speaking population. In order to assess to which extent valence and
  emotionality are automatically processed when reading a word, participants"
  reaction time was recorded as a complement of their electrodermal response.
  These measurement5 were used to rank the word5 into two different lists,
  conforming the set of Spanish-words. The reaction time to negative words were
  only significantly slower to reaction times of positive ones (and not to the
  neutral ones).
